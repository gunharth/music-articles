# Improvisation Tools - Arpeggios
by Gunharth Randolf  (23 Jan 03) 

This is the second of a series of articles to familiarize you with the tools used in improvisation. See "Improvisation Tools: Pentatonic" for Part 1 in the series. In order to get the most out of this article you should have at least some experience in improvising. 

The series of articles "Improvisation Tools" does not attempt to be a prescriptive method that specifies exactly how you should apply a particular tool to a specific chord or give you exact practicing schedules. Rather, they are intended to show you some ideas on how to approach and practice these tools.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions or criticism please feel free to post them in the forums here at iBreathe. I hope that this article is helpful and that you have fun studying it.


## Introduction

Before we actually start working on arpeggios we have to define the term "arpeggio" and how it is used throughout this article. An arpeggio is a series of single notes that spell out a Triad or a 7th chord (For further information refer to the harmony section on this site). Notice that this article is entirely about 7th chords arpeggios, meaning the 4 different single notes that make up major7, minor7, dom7, m7b5, and dim7 . Therefore, knowledge of intervalic construction of each chord family is absolutely vital.

Whereas chordal thinking has a more vertical direction arpeggios show a strong horizontal direction and therefore are very useful in improvisation. Due to the fact that 4 note arpeggios contain all notes of a chord the term "Chord Tones" sometimes seems to be more appropriate. I will use both expressions interchangeably. For clarity: when saying arpeggio I refer to a fingering or pattern, when saying chord tones I am thinking of individual intervals that make up the chord, e.g. root or perfect fifth.

Important: You do not have to learn everything at once in this article. I encourage you to read through it and see what you can apply to your playing. Go as far as you are interested in and/or pick out the topics that you have the feeling of being helpful.


## Part 1: Arpeggios in 5 Positions

### Major 7

I don't know what your first experience with arpeggios was or if you ever had one. In my case I learned my first fingerings in close connection with 7th chord voicings and looking back I think this is a good way to start out. In most books arpeggio fingerings are presented in more or less 5 main positions. Although you may have learned different ones I encourage you to follow the fingerings and exercises on the next few pages. 

I will demonstrate everything with focus on maj7 arpeggios. At the end of Part 1 you can find the fingerings for the other chord families to which you can then apply the learned maj7 approach on your own. 

The 5 positions are demonstrated by listing the most common major7 voicing with the arpeggio next to it, so that you can set them in relation to each other. Furthermore I included the individual intervals/chord tones of the voicing and the arpeggio. Note that it is very important to learn the positions of the chord tones. On the bottom of each position I included a notation part with fingerings of the voicing and the related arpeggio. Notice that I start the arpeggio on the lowest possible root.

### First Drill & Exercises

Before you take a look at all 5 positions you should perform some exercises with each fingering. If you have finished the drill to your satisfaction, move on to the next position.

**Exercise 1**

Take the voicing and the arpeggio and transpose them through the circle of fifth, i.e., C, G, D, A, E, B, Gb, Db, Ab, Eb, Bb, F, and back to C. Play the maj7 voicing first followed by the arpeggio. I recommend the use of a metronome. Try to bring the rests between voicings and arpeggios to an absolute minimum.
Example: Metronome bpm = 80 -100

**Exercise 2**

Improvise with focus on chord tones. This exercise will help you to memorize the location of individual chord tones in each position. 

Record a Cmaj7 vamp (3 minutes) -- now let's say we focus on the root. Try to improvise using only the note C . Our first fingering includes twice the root which are an octave apart (on A and g string).

Now take the 3rd (E), 5th (G) and 7th (B) and repeat the procedure.
Then take combinations: Improvise with roots and 3rds only -- or 5th and 7th.

Transpose the exercise in different keys. I recommend to think in numbers and not in note names because the location of the Chord tones in relation to the root stay the same independent from the position you are in.


### More Patterns and Exercises

### Ideas & Exercises

We have already spent some time with our 5 different arpeggio fingerings. Up to now we have played them more or less up and down. Here are some examples of "breaking up" the patterns (for a detailed explanation of the exercises below refer to my article about the Pentatonic).

All examples are shown using the Cmaj7 pattern in 5th position (#2 from above).

**In "3rds"**

### Second Drill & Exercises

**Exercise 1**

We repeat the first exercise from above. Use the circle of fifth. The only difference is that we do not move the patterns around on the neck, instead we try to stay as close as possible in positions. Play the major7 voicing followed by the arpeggio.

**Exercise 2**

With this exercise we try to create a continuous ascending and descending line by changing from one pattern to another. In the example below I switch between Cmaj7 and Gmaj7. Try to connect the two different fingerings as smoothly as possible.

- Try the above exercise by starting on every individual chord tone of the Cmaj7 Arpeggio.
- Try this exercise with different maj7 chords and/or use the circle of fifth.


## Review

All right. We have learnt 5 fingerings for the maj7 arpeggio, done some drills and applied technical exercises. Two patterns had the lowest root on the low E string, two on the A string and one on the D string. I owe you an explanation why these are the main 5 patterns. If we take a look at the entire guitar neck and project all 5 Cmaj7 patterns on it, we see that these 5 patterns contain all Chord tones that are spread over the neck. Furthermore you see where common tones of neighboring patterns are.

You can include another pattern into the above neck diagram that incorporates open strings . Move the pattern that starts on the 12th fret (in the black circle) down by one octave.

## Minor 7 Arpeggios

It is a good idea to see these patterns in close relation to the 5 Pentatonic patterns (see Improvisation Tools - Pentatonic. There is only one note difference between Minor Pentatonic and Minor Arpeggio -- Minor Pentatonic includes a Perfect 4th).

Quick repeat: Minor7 = 1, b3, P5, b7, Cm7= c eb g bb

It is obvious that you should apply all major exercises to minor. I encourage you to examine each individual fingering regarding their intervalic structure. Here are some examples:
- Where are the minor thirds in the patterns and which fingers play them?
- Imagine you only know roots and fifth. Improvise with them.
- What is my highest / lowest chord tone in each pattern?
- Practice 4- note sequence, 3- note sequence, and exercise in "3rds".
- Apply all drills and exercises to the minor arpeggio fingerings.



## Combining Major and Minor

Here's an example of how you can apply one of the drill exercises to major and minor. Try to play a continuous line and think of the chord tones you resolve to when changing the chord (and fingering).

Other combinations: 
I Am7 I Cmaj7 I
I Fmaj7 I Em7 I


## Dominant 7 Arpeggios

The third chord family are dominant seventh arpeggios. There should be no need to say that you should repeat all steps introduced with major arpeggios (and hopefully practiced with minor too).

Quick repeat: Dominant7 = 1, M3, P5, b7, C7= c e g bb

If you want to focus entirely on Dominant7 arpeggios you could practice them by using a basic Blues progression:


C7 Blues
```text
I C7  /  /  /  I /  /  /  /  I /  /  /  /  I /  /  /  /  I 

I F7  /  /  /  I /  /  /  /  I C7 /  /  /  I /  /  /  /  I 

I G7  /  /  /  I F7 /  /  /  I C7 /  /  /  I G7 /  /  /  I
```

- Try to adapt the drills and exercises we talked about.
- Improvise with focusing on single chord tones.
