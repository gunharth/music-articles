*Intervals are the key to understanding everything you will ever learn in music or play on your instrument. Think about it: scales are made up of intervals, chords are made up of intervals, melodies are made up of intervals, the music you play, write, listen to ..... breaking it down ... intervals are the primary building blocks.*

*I have received many harmony related questions, e.g. modes and scales and the answer to these questions always lie in the concept of intervals and the knowledge surrounding them. So here's my advice - study them to the degree of perfection. Know them in your sleep!*

*I hope with this article I will provide you with all necessary theory, knowledge and exercises to master this topic for good :-)*

1. [The Terminology](#terminology)
1. [Perfect Intervals](#perfect-intervals)



Western Music, its melodic and harmonic concept, is based on a very mathematical system to describe the relationship between two single notes. These relationships are called intervals. The term "interval" comes from Latin and means something like ‘the valley inbetween'.

**An interval describes the distance between two notes**


That's it!?! I had to wait for this page to load just to get this wise description!?! Well, let's get serious. The sentence above is simplistic of course, but in essence it stands for what intervals are: A mathematical concept, a strict meassurement.... In the same way you would explain to somebody the way from point A (your favorite pub) to point B (your favorite blues bar), you describe the distance between two notes. The difference being that with music, it's intervals that are your miles and minutes.

Before we go into further detail let's just have a quick look at how we come across intervals with two examples. Note that these can be seen vertically, meaning single notes stacked upon each other, ie a chordal/harmonic approach, and horizontally, meaning single notes played one after the other, ie a melodic approach.

### 2 single notes
```text
Melodic Interval - notes sounding one after the other

Note 1       Note 2
  |____________|
    1 interval
```

```text
Harmonic Interval - notes sounding at the same time

Note 2 -
        |
        | 1 interval
        |
Note 1 -
```

### 3 single notes (triad):
```text
Melodic

Note 1       Note 2       Note 3
  |____________|____________|
   1st interval 2nd interval

  |_________________________|
          3rd interval
```
```text
Harmonic

Note 3 -              -
        |              |
        | 2nd interval |
        |              |
Note 2 -               | 3rd interval
        |              |
        | 1st interval |
        |              |
Note 1 -              -
```

Feel free to examine 4 notes or apply the above to a scale. So how about one single note you might ask. Well, as long it's just one note- no real interval is involved. But let's say we play the same note twice (either on the same instrument or on two different instruments) then an interval is involved. In our metaphorical example this would mean that your favorite pub is also your favorit Blues bar (ya a lucky guy:-).

Ok let's dig a bit deeper.
You are all familiar with the concept of time as we measure it. If I say "1 hour", you have a clear understanding of what this means, the same with minutes and seconds. In the same way intervals are a concept with units and a corresponding terminology.


## <a name="terminology"></a>The Terminology

In order to measure the distance between two notes we have to define two main families of intervals.

The first family is called **Perfect Intervals**. The second family is called **Major or Minor Intervals**. Whereas our Perfect Interval family solely exists of one option, (ie Perfect), the Major or Minor Intervals family can take 2 forms: either Major or Minor, whereas Minor means “not as far away as Major", (ie Minor is always one half step below major).

Below is a graphical visualisation of the above said. Remember, we are talking about a distance here.

It wouldn't be in the nature of science (and music theory is a vast science) if there weren't some options/complications. No worries though - it's all structured and logical.

To both families of intervals there are 'alterations', which help us in certain situations to be more accurate in describing the distance between two notes.

This is how it goes: altering from our two main families we can distinguish between Augmented and Diminished, whereas Augmented expands upon the original family (by a half step) and Diminished lowers it (by a half step).

Let's look at our visual examples again:

![alt text](../img/intervals02.gif "augmented diminished")


### A Quick Review

So far we have learned some important terminology which is used to describe the distance between notes. We know that there are Perfect Intervals and that there are intervals that can be either 'Major or Minor'.

Note: Intervals can only belong to one of these families - it can't be Perfect and Major or Major and Minor or Perfect and Minor. An interval can only be Perfect or Major or Minor.

Then we learned that there are options in the 2 main families called Diminished and Augmented. Augmented expands upon the original interval family and Diminished lowers it.

Now that the terminology is out of the way we can talk about the ‘units' that are used in describing music and thus intervals and their names.


The Units: Interval Names

Intervals are always named in relation to a Root note and then by their order of appearance. It's best to take a look at all of the natural note names (all white keys on the piano) and thus the C major scale.




As you can see you start counting from the Root (1). Apart from the Root (1) and the Octave (8) all notes are named according to their order of appearance. The word 'Root' became more accepted than previously 'the prime' or 'the first' as it better describes the starting position. If we play the Root twice at the same time it is called a 'Unison' (Latin for together). The Octave is a relic from the classical naming of intervals.

Now I'm sorry to tell you that saying Second, Fifth or Sixth is not enough. This would be too easy and would result in us authors being unemployment :-). This is where our terminology comes in that we learned in the beginning.


## <a name="perfect-intervals"></a>Perfect Intervals

Root, Fourth, Fifth and Octave are Perfect

In our C Major example this would be the notes c, f, g and again c. 'Perfect' describes those intervals that are the framework for building scales and chords. Perfect Intervals stay the same, whether you build a major or a minor scale. An exact translation of Perfect Intervals from its German origin would be "Clean Intervals" (reine Intervalle). It describes that they are consonant Intervals and therefore sound clean and perfect.

Let's take another look at our C Major Scale




Let me just point out some observations (some more obvious than others) to the image above as we can look at it in different ways:
Perfect Root and Perfect Octave are the same note, one octave apart

It takes 12 half steps (6 whole steps) to get from the root to the Perfect Octave

There are 6 different other note names between Root and Perfect Octave

it takes 2 whole steps and a half step to get from the Root to the Perfect Fourth

it takes 5 half steps to get from the Root to the Perfect Fourth

there are 2 different other note names between Root and Perfect Fourth
I'll leave the rest up to you..... make up your own to better visualise the above.
Now that we have a clear understanding of what Perfect intervals are we can transform these 'rules' to roots other than 'c'.

Example: Root is d
Question: What is the Perfect Fourth of d?
To figure this one out we have a few different options, based on our observations above:

1) it takes 2 whole steps and a half step to get from the Root to the Perfect Fourth:
root = d, 1st whole step = e, 2nd whole step = f#, half step = g
Perfect Fourth from d is g.

2) it takes 5 half steps to get from the Root to the Perfect Fourth:
root = d, 1st half step = d#, 2nd hs = e, 3rd hs = f, 4th hs = f#, 5th hs = g
Perfect Fourth from d is g.

3) It's really important and the whole reason for this article, that you learn this by heart! : Perfect Fourth from d is g.


Memorising Intervals

So how do you approach memorising all the intervals of all possible roots. Here's my tip. Learn the intervals from notes without sharps and flats first and then add flats or sharps when needed.

We just figured out that the Perfect Fourth from d is g. If I'd ask you for the Perfect Fourth from db, which is just a half step below d, we do not need to start counting again - we just lower the result from d by a half step, thus gb. The Perfect Fourth from db is gb. The Perfect Fourth from d# is g#. See how this works?

So if ya know all Perfect Intervals starting on a natural note name you can easily transform this to all other notes.

And here they are - memorise them (I excluded the octave as this is pretty obvious):
```text
Root         Perfect Fourth          Perfect Fifth

 c                  f                      g

 d                  g                      a

 e                  a                      b

 f                  bb                     c

 g                  c                      d

 a                  d                      e

 b                  e                      f#
```


A common Pitfall

With the above list of intervals starting on natural note names, you may already have some queries. Sorry for me being so cautious but I wanna make sure that this is all clear and logical to you (this is our main goal here

The example starting on the note f might bother you. The Perfect Fourth has a flat in it. Why? and why isn't it an option to say that a# (which is the same pitch as bb) is the perfect fourth of f?

The answer, again, lies in the observations we made earlier, which are basically our rules to work out an interval. Let me take those observations apart with the f to a# example:

a# is 2 whole steps and a half step way from f = it could be the perfect fourth
a# is 5 half steps away from f = it could be the perfect fourth
BUT
there are no other 2 note names between f and a#. The only note name inbetween is g. Basically a# includes the note name a, which is the third note you come across when starting to count from f. Thus a# cannot be the fourth and must be some kind of third.
